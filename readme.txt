   uwopeople-ods-url // Change the url that is being used to populate user information.

Q: Can i overwrite the default style of this plugin?
A: Yes you are recommended to do this using CSS so you will receive all updates that new versions may bring. However you do have the option to completely override the template files by placing a views/uwopeople-single.php or views/uwopeople-archive.php in your theme folder. You can copy the default views rendered from the views folder to make your life easier.
